            <ul>
                <li>
                    Heat a large nonstick pot over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and let cook for about 5-6 minutes, or until browned. Make sure to break apart and separate the chunks using a wooden spoon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reduce heat to medium, add garlic and let cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add wine or broth, stirring well, to loosen any meat from the bottom, and let cook for about 2 minutes or until reduced.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in the tomato sauce, water, and pasta, making sure the liquids are well mixed with the pasta. Cover and let cook for about 10-12 minutes (it varies depending on the type of pasta you use), or until al dente. Stir pasta occasionally during the cooking process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you use a chicken or beef broth with a good sodium content, you may not need added salt. But if you use wine, stir about Â½ to 1 teaspoon of salt into the liquids before cooking pasta.
                </li>
                <li>
                    (OPTIONAL) Only if desired, add frozen peas to the pasta about 4-5 minutes before cooking ends. Garnish with Parmesan and fresh basil leaves if desired.
                </li>
            </ul>
